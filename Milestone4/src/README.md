# J--_Compiler Milestone4 (final)

Milestone4 implements the Code Generation component of the CPSC411 J-- compiler project.
It takes the annotated AST generated by Milestone3 as input, and generates code in MIPS assembly.

To compile and run this program, execute:

    make
    ./main <file>

To redirect the output to a file and run it with a MIPS processor simulator such as SPIM, execute:

    ./main <file> > <output_file>
    spim -f <output_file>

The output of the compiler and the result of running it with SPIM on the test files on the UCalgary CPSC Linux Servers, can be found in ../results
Files that end in .s are generated by the J-- compiler.
Files that end in .out contain the SPIM output.

Notes:
- the version of spim used for output, was located at `aycock/411/bin` on the UCalgary CPSC Linux Servers
- the first line of each .out file can be ignored; it was displayed from redirecting the output of `spim -f <file>.s` to a file (i.e. `~aycock/411/binspim -f <file>.s > <file>.out`)
- for gen.t10.out, I ended the program early because recursive fibonacci takes a while
- for gen.t13.out, my input during runtime was "hello there racecar"
- for gen.t18.out, my input during runtime was "12*-8", followed by ENTER, followed by "+"
- for gen.t33.out, my input during runtime was "Hi mom! :^)", followed by ENTER, followed by CTRL-D
